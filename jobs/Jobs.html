                    <h4>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</h4>
                    <p><B>Software Engineer</B>
<p>A software engineer 's job involves the design and programming of software at the system level, including operating systems , database systems and embedded systems.
They know how both software and hardware work. In the electronics and telecommunications industries, software engineers are also found.
For a software engineering profession, a computing, software engineering or related degree is required.</p>

<p><B>Systems Analyst</p></B>
<p>In order to increase business performance and effectiveness, systems analysts use computer systems to investigate and analyze business issues and then develop information systems that offer a realistic solution,
usually in response to demands from their organization or a client. For analyst programmers,
it can be a job to step into and usually requires a few years of experience after graduation.</p>

<p><B>Business Analyst</p></B>
<p>Business analysts find opportunities for the use of information technology to enhance processes and business operations.
The task is project-based and starts with the examination of the requirements of a client, the selection and documentation of requirements and the creation of a project plan to design the resulting technology solution.
To become a business analyst, you will need an understanding of technology, but you will not necessarily need a professional degree.</p>

<p><B>Technical Support</p></B>
<p>These are the IT world's trained trouble shooters. They track and maintain an organisation's information systems and networks.
Organisations depend tremendously on technical support officers. Some support lines involve professionals with specific expertise and skills, but for graduates, technical support may also be a good way into the industry.</p>

<p><B>Network Engineer</p></B>
<p>One of the most technically challenging IT jobs is network engineering. The function includes the implementation, maintenance, support, creation and design
of communication networks within or between organizations within an organization. Protection,
information storage and disaster recovery techniques are also the responsibility of network engineers. A degree related to telecoms or computer science is required.</p>

<p><B>Technical Consultant</p></B>
<p>In order to develop and execute IT programs for external customers, professional consultants have technical expertise.
At any or all phases of the project lifecycle, they might be involved: pitching for a contract; refining a customer team specification, designing the system,
handling part or all of the project after sales support and even writing the code. For this position, a professional degree would be helpful, but not always required.</p>

<p><B>Technical Sales Engineer</p></B>
<p>In technology and distribution, technical sales engineers provide guidance and support for a variety of products.
You may sell hardware or praise the business advantages of entire systems or services. The work could include regular phone calls, meetings ,
conferences and proposals for drafting. A degree in technology is not necessarily necessary, but you would need to have a detailed technical knowledge of the product you are selling./<p>


<p><B>Project Manager</p></B>
<p>Project managers schedule and coordinate resources and individuals to ensure that tasks are completed on time,
remain within budget and fulfill the expectations of the organization. From start to finish, they can manage a whole project or manage part of a larger 'programme'.
It is not an entry-level job and requires experience and a strong base of soft skills and technology that are necessary for working with tech development teams and company managers at higher levels.</p>


<p><B>Web Developer</p></B>
<p>Web development is a broad concept that encompasses everything to do with website construction and all of the infrastructure behind it.
The jobs can range from designing an intranet for workers to developing an online retailer's payment system.
Most web developers have IT skills and experience, but you can start immediately after university as a junior web developer and work your way up.
</p>
<p><B>Software Tester</p></B>
<p>The quality assurance stage of software development and implementation is taken care of by a software tester.
To ensure that the software produced by developers is fit for purpose, they perform manual checks.
In order to predict pitfalls until work starts, testers may often be engaged in the early stages of ventures.
The programming and use of coding languages would be familiar to many software testers. The majority of software testers will have a computer science or IT degree.</p></p>
